<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Background the Project

Bullying cases in the environment often occur. Data released by the Indonesian Teachers' Union Federation has released data on bullying cases in 2023 from January to September. handicapped or disabled, including those who are speech impaired, they are unable to communicate like other students even though communication is very important. The way to overcome this is actually to send children with disabilities to special schools (SLB), but problems arise if students who have these disabilities go to conventional schools where the majority of other students communicate normally using their mouths, but students with speech impairments can only communicate using sign language. so this can make things difficult for other students and can also become a source of insults and targets for student bullying.
to overcome this we created "DiFA" a sign language translator application by detecting movements from the hands of the SIBI sign language "Indonesian Sign system", using an Image recognition system using the transfer learning algorithm () to detect images of hand movements so that users can translate his speech impaired friend's hand movements in real life using a camera so that non-speech students can understand what the speech impaired students are saying without having to first understand the sign language system
With this application, we hope that there will be no more bullying that happens to students with speech impairments and also that other children can better understand what is being communicated by students with speech impairments, which can be understood by both students and teachers, thereby supporting a more inclusive world.
